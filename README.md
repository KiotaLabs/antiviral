# antiviral
we have conceived of a smartphone utility that can help track the current and future trajectory of the virus. The app is supposed to work the same way, as Google Maps does, in showing you the traffic situation on your travel routes. The app (which still needs a name by the way), will use the location indicator on your phone to track your movement through crowds and as you interact with people around you. If at any point in time you find out about someone having contracted the virus, including yourself (unfortunately), then you can share that information on the app. Our servers would then look at the past timelines of the movements of those people, and their interactions with other people, and therefore come up with an estimate of the spread of the disease.
